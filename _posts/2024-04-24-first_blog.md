# My Very First Blog Post. Ever.
Hi there! This is the the start of my blogging experience. I **never** thought I'd make a blog, but here we are.
This is a test post so that I could wrap my head around how to use [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## Learning Experiences
Surprisingly, making my own free open blog was easier than expected, largely thanks to the fantastic fast.ai tutorial [here](https://www.fast.ai/posts/2020-01-16-fast_template.html)
I've had to learn a lot about how to use markdown, which I've never had to use before, but which is needed to make all my blog posts look so pretty ðŸ˜‡
This markdown [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) on Github has proven *super super* useful.

## Issues
So far, everything has been smooth sailing thankfully. I'm hoping it will stay that way, but if 4 years of programming has taught me anything, it's that chances are slim ðŸ˜†
