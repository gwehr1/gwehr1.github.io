# Welcome!
This is my personal blog, where I have made posts on all the interesting things I've learnt about AI, particularly focussing on **fastai**.
As Professor Lovell liked to tell us in ELEC4630 at UQ, 
> "Blogging helps you learn!"

## Purpose
While this blog was created to help me with my understanding, I've documented several issues that I've faced throughout my journey with AI, which hopefully may also even help *you*, should you happen to come across similar issues ðŸ˜„
If you have time, you should definitely check out fast.ai - it's a fantastic course that makes deep learning accessible to everyone ðŸ’«

## Structure
This blog was created using the [fast.ai blog template](https://www.fast.ai/posts/2020-01-16-fast_template.html) and [github pages](https://pages.github.com/). Each page deals with a unique learning experience or issue encountered. With that said, feel free to take a look around!
